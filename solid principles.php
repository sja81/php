<?php
// SOLID

// Single response
// a class should have one, and only one, reason to change. 

// Open-Closed
// Entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification
// Change behavior without modifying source code
// avoid code rot
// polymorphism
// create hide extension to interface, like PaymentInterface

// Liskov substitution
// Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.
